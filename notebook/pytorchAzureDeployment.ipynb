We are talking about how the user is going to interact with the app. Suppose for example in the web app we are going to implement, it is related to image, so we need to provide a button option to the end user to click and upload the image. Once user selects the image, it is nice to have it displayed on the screen. Also need to make sure user selects only image files not some other files like executables or scripts which will compromise our web application from malicious activities.
